# Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB Authentication API

This project is meant to be used as a starting point for APIs that require user Authentication (registration and sign in).
All sign in sessions are directed to protected routes that pass through an authentication middleware.

The project uses ;

- Mongoose for data modelling.
- Express.js for server setup.
- randomtoken node.js module as authentication token
- bcrypt to hash passwords before storing in database

It API includes;

- User registration
- Login
- Password Reset
- User Account verification
- Account activation and deactivation by admin
- Unit tests for API routes, run `npm test`
- API documentation `./API doc`


## Setup

- Clone repo
- From server folder
  > npm install
- Add MongoDB URI and email credentials to .env file
  > npm start
- Test endpoints

## Overview of auth system:

1. User registers account. Password is hashed and salted with bcrypt before being stored in the database.
2. User enters login credentials for login, server validates the credentials, if it's valid, it generates a JWT token.
   this token will be used along side every request post-login.
3. Token is sent in a json format after server response.
4. On every request post-login, client attaches the access token in the request header.
5. Request sent to protected endpoints go through an authentication middleware, which validates the accesstoken received.

## Password reset
1. User sends password reset request
2. API issues a reset token and sends to user's email address (token expires after 2mins).
3. API creates a JWT access token, will be required to authenticate the user when completing the password reset process
4. User sends request with new password and reset-token and access token (access token will be used in the Authorization header as Bearer token).
4. API confirms token then updates user's password in DB.

## Super Admin 
1. Can activate and deactivate user account

The email client requires an email address and password, not the password to the email, but a secondary password to access email function with google.
